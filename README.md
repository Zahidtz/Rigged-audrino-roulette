# Rigged-audrino-roulette
This project is a roulette game using an Arduino and three LEDs (red, blue, and green). The roulette has a rigged 70% chance of landing on green, a 15% chance of landing on blue, and a 15% chance of landing on red. The Arduino code generates a random number between 0 and 99, and uses if statements to determine which LED to turn on based on the probability of landing on each color. The selected LED is then turned on for 1 second before being turned off and the game starts again. The user can play the game by pressing a button to trigger the roulette spin. This project is a fun and interactive way to learn about probability and random number generation with Arduino.
